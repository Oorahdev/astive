# ATK: Toolkit and Application Server for Asterisk PBX

Astive Toolkit(ATK) was designed to overcome the complexity of building custom voice applications on Asterisk PBX. ATK, uses Asterisk's AGI and AMI to create powerful interactive menus with Java. Most of ATK functions can be replaced to allow third-parties implementations or services.

ATK makes creating voice applications easier for developers, however, it is important to have a good Asterisk foundation. To learn some key concepts and get up and running, check out the following tutorials:
